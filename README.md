# Under Construction
This project is under construction. The features are complete. 

I am building more site administration pages to allow the Admin to  change the images displayed on their home page slide show. They will also be able to set their header image and background image. Anyone that wants to use this for their church can. If you have suggestions, requests, or improvements let me know. Thank you!

I am working on Styling and CSS.

If you choose to run it, you will need to set up MySQL accordingly. Additionally you will need to set up a different security key, and get your own API Authorization code from the American Bible Society. This is a Maven Project and uses hibernate. You will need to do a Maven update to get all the Maven Dependencies. You will also to need to import the following to build the React Project. Once you have the project downloaded, navigate to the folder it lives in in the terminal and then type npm i react-router react-router-dom

If you need help, contact me. In the future I will post the Maven Build and React Project Build so you can just set this up on your server.
